        I am a third-year PhD student at MIT where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~gbresler/" target="_blank">Guy Bresler</a>. My current research focuses on high-dimensional statistics. I am specifically interested in the interplay between dimensionality of data, information, and computational efficiency. I have worked on problems related to high-dimensional random geometric graphs and noisy linear equations over finite fields.

        Before coming to MIT, I was an undergraduate at Princeton where I was lucky to work with Matt Weinberg on problems in algorithmic game theory. I have also worked in combinatorics. Check out my research page!
